      "question": "If all lawyers passed the bar exam, and Maria is a lawyer, what can we conclude about Maria?",
      "answer": "Maria passed the bar exam.",
      "explanation": "This is a basic syllogism. The major premise states all lawyers passed the bar exam. The minor premise states Maria is a lawyer. Therefore, Maria must have passed the bar exam. This tests your understanding of necessary conditions."

      "question": "Every time it rains, the streets get wet. The streets are wet today. Can we conclude it rained?",
      "answer": "No, we cannot definitively conclude it rained.",
      "explanation": "This is a common logical fallacy called 'affirming the consequent.' While rain causes wet streets, wet streets don't necessarily mean it rained\u2014there could be other causes like a street cleaner or burst pipe. The streets being wet is necessary but not sufficient to conclude it rained."

      "answer": "Lawyer C arrived first.",

      "question": "A law firm has four associates: Alex, Bailey, Carter, and Dana. Exactly two of them are working on Contract Law, and exactly two are working on Criminal Law. If Alex is working on Contract Law and Bailey is not working on the same type of law as Alex, what can we determine?",
      "answer": "Bailey is working on Criminal Law.",
      "explanation": "Since Alex is on Contract Law and Bailey is not on the same type (Contract Law), Bailey must be on Criminal Law. We can't determine what Carter and Dana are working on without more information, but we know one must be Contract and one must be Criminal to satisfy the 'exactly two' constraint."

      "answer": "At least one student must have both.",
      "explanation": "Using the pigeonhole principle: if at least 3 have internships and at least 3 completed first year, and there are only 5 students total, there must be at least 1 overlap (3 + 3 = 6, but there are only 5 students)."

      "answer": "No, we cannot conclude that.",
      "explanation": "This commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. While all successful takers studied regularly (successful \u2192 studied), knowing someone studied regularly doesn't guarantee success. Studying regularly is necessary but not sufficient for LSAT success."

The Torts book is immediately to the right of the Criminal Law book. If Contracts is in position 4, what is the earliest position Criminal Law could be in?",
      "answer": "Position 1.",
      "explanation": "Constitutional Law must be left of Contracts (position 4), so it's in positions 1, 2, or 3. Criminal Law and Torts are adjacent (Criminal-Torts order). The earliest Criminal could be is position 1, with Torts in position 2."

      "answer": "The witness is lying.",
      "explanation": "This is a disjunctive syllogism: Either A or B. Not B. Therefore, A. Since it's either the witness is lying OR the defendant is guilty, and the defendant is NOT guilty, the witness must be lying."

      "explanation": "N is Wednesday. O is immediately after M (M-O are consecutive). M is before P. If M were Monday, O would be Tuesday, N Wednesday, P Thursday\u2014this works! But if M were Tuesday, O is Wednesday (but N is Wednesday\u2014conflict). Therefore, M is Monday... Wait, let me reconsider. If N is Wednesday and O is immediately after M, M-O must be consecutive. M can't be Wednesday. If M is Tuesday, O is Wednesday, but N is Wednesday. Conflict. If M is Monday, O is Tuesday, N is Wednesday, P is Thursday. This works! So M appears on Monday. Actually, rereading the question\u2014I need to reconsider all scenarios properly. Let me verify: N=Wednesday. O is immediately after M. Possible: Mon-Tue, Tue-Wed, Wed-Thu. If M-O is Tue-Wed, that means M=Tue, O=Wed, but N=Wed. Conflict. If M-O is Mon-Tue, M=Mon, O=Tue, N=Wed, P=Thu. M before P? Yes. This works!"

      "answer": "Office 3 or 4.",
      "explanation": "W is in office 1. X is not adjacent to W (so not office 2). Y is in office 3. X can be office 3 (same as Y if shared) or office 4. If offices aren't shared, X must be office 4 (since Y has 3). Actually, if one person per office: W=1, Y=3, Z and X in 2 and 4. X not adjacent to W means X \u2260 2. So X=4, Z=2."

No, D must be immediately after B. Let me reconsider: B-D are consecutive. E is last (5). A before C. Option 1: B(1), D(2), A(3), C(4), E(5). A before C \u2713. Option 2: A(1), B(2), D(3), C(4), E(5). A before C \u2713. So C can be position 4."
